# Supermarket-Customer-Profiling-
We use clustering techniques to identify supermarket customer profiles.

Mass campaigns consume a lot of resources and may not yield great results. The cost of the marketing campaigns can be reduced by identifying the target customer profiles.

In this project, we used both classification and regression techniques to develop a predictive model for predicting membership purchase.
